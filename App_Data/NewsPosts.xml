		Title="Did the CDC Just Cure BitterScale?"
		Date="2.02.2073"
		Content="In an international conference earlier this week, BitterScale taskforce researcher James Harrow reported success in treating the disease in laboratory conditions. He is said to have exclaimed that BitterScale 'is easily treated with the compound [we've] developed here at the CDC'. The results he has published this week paint a hopeful light, making a viable cure seem all the more likely to come sooner rather than later. Those of us stuck in the quarantine look forward to his next publication!" />
