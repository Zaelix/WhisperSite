		Title="Did the CDC Just Cure BitterScale?"
		Date="2.06.2073"
		Content="In an international conference earlier this week, BitterScale taskforce researcher James Harrow reported success in treating the disease in laboratory conditions. He is said to have exclaimed that BitterScale 'is easily treated with the compound [we've] developed here at the CDC'. The results he has published this week paint a hopeful light, making a viable cure seem all the more likely to come sooner rather than later. Those of us stuck in the quarantine look forward to his next publication!" />

		Title="CLN Stock Rises Inexplicably"
		Date="1.28.2073"
		Content="In the early hours of the morning, Cerberus Logistics Network stock had a massive unexplained spike in value, raising more than 45% in under twenty minutes. Analysts are baffled at the inexplicable rise, citing the lack of any noteworthy news on the company's part this week. No representatives from CLN were available for comment, but a spokesperson from AlphaTech, a subsidiary of CLN, expressed equal confusion over the change. While experts dig into the details to try to uncover the truth, we're left wondering just one thing: did any of our readers manage to sell any stock during the spike?" />

		Title="Unidentified Satellite Located in Decaying Orbit"
		Date="1.21.2073"
		Content="It's not every day we get compelling space news anymore. Interest in the final frontier has been touchy since goblinization, but it may have been renewed last night when amateur astronomers and corporations alike simultaneously spotted a craft that isn't listed on any corporation's satellite registries. The craft has an unusual radar signature unlike that of any common aerospace materials we use today. Even more strange is that it appears to be in a decaying orbit, and will likely light up the sky later this week as it plummets to Earth. Speculation around the nature of the craft litters the matrix, with the usual elements claiming that extraterrestrial origins are more likely than a Corp shadow project. " />

		Title="Automated Security Devices in High Demand"
		Date="1.17.2073"
		Content="For those stores without much security, small-scale looting of security devices has resulted in a loss of profit in this quarantine. For those stores who have adequate protection, it has led to massive profits. Cameras, maglocks, and turret systems have all been selling for many multiples their standard prices in the past couple of days. Consequently, Breaking and Entering gear (and the skills that go along with it) has also risen in price. Just having security isn't enough, though; many magical supply stores have been burgled by naga in the past week. Cyber and astral experts Jackson Mayn and Hazel Williams, respectively, of Astral Anomalies in downtown were both put in critical condition yesterday when the store was attacked by an organized squad of infected naga. Store management declined to comment on which items were stolen." />

		Title="Seattle Thrown to the Wolves (Or snakes)"
		Date="1.14.2073"
		Content="Early this morning, security forces began quietly retreating from the city. The quarantine has been in effect for less than a week, and already Knight Errant forces have given up on any enforcement inside the perimeter. Those of us still inside the city are left wondering; how long can we last without them?" />

		Title="Seattle Giving Chicago a Run for its Money"
		Date="1.09.2073"
		Content="CDC and Knight Errant forces have jointly announced a quarantine of the Seattle area. A hotline has been created specifically for what is now called the BitterScale virus, and citizens are asked to call with any information or reports regarding reptiles infected with the disease. Send all reports to the CDC @ CDC.Alert:BitterScale.GlobalNet, or Knight Errant @ KE911:BSVirus.EmeraldCityGrid" />

		Title="2072 Ends with Fire in the Sky"
		Date="1.01.2073"
		Content="As the ball dropped in Times Square last night, a surprise meteor shower over the eastern seaboard sparkled mysteriously. As citizens watched in awe as the sky lit up, aerospace company employees were panicking in their respective mission control centers worldwide. Reports this morning make it clear it was no meteor shower that heralded the new year, but rather a synchronized attack that resulted in the destabilization of nearly two hundred satellites' low-earth orbits. No groups have claimed credit for the attack yet." />

		Title="Local Bodyguard Industry Booming"
		Date="12.28.2072"
		Content="Thanks to the as-yet-unexplained increase in unreasoning reptilian killing machines, the Seattle bodyguard demand has skyrocketed. Prices have jumped to astronomical levels, attracting top talent from across the continent. Citizens clamour to hire protective services as the missing persons count rises to quadruple digits in the last two months alone, and Knight Errant forces come under fire as the public demand to know what their plans for remedying the situation are." />

		Title="Seattle Voted 'The Reptile Room of the World' by Snemony Licket Magazine"
		Date="12.23.2072"
		Content="For those of you who are reptile lovers, Seattle may just be a new paradise. For those who prefer not getting bitten, injected with paralytic venom, and dragged off to a dark nest deep underground, it most certainly is not a paradise at all. The CDC has elevated their travel advisory to a Level 3 Warning, urging all non-essential travel to stay away from Seattle until further notice. Knight Errant forces have also issued their own warning, urging citizens to consider installing security doors and windows if they don't already have them, and suggesting that outdoor nighttime activities be limited to heavily populated areas only." />

		Title="Horizon Happily Escapes Stock Price Massacre"
		Date="12.16.2072"
		Content="Last month, Horizon surreptitiously launched a mega-station into space using experimental magitech. Hopes were high for what they were internally calling the 'New Dawn' station until comms with the station went dark less than a week after launch. The loss of such a substantial asset made investors understandably nervous, especially in light of Saeder-Krupp's upcoming rival project. Now Horizon claims that it has reestablished communication with the station, and happily reports that it is still up and running after some technical difficulties on board. " />

		Title="Black-outs are Back Out in Seattle"
		Date="12.09.2072"
		Content="Rolling blackouts hit the entire western seaboard this morning, thanks in part to the continued attacks on power production plants worldwide over the past months. The most heavily hit is Saeder-Krupp, who report damages and setbacks in excess of 7Â¥ billion to their latest aerospace endeavour, which was scheduled to launch on New Year's eve. A new launch date has not been announced." />

		Title="Possible Reptilian Ultra-rabies Discovered!"
		Date="12.04.2072"
		Content="In an update to last week's story about The Scales, new reports have suggested that the loose gang of reptilians may be carriers of a virulent new plague causing extreme aggression and loss of language in those affected. While the exact effects are thus far unknown, the CDC has issued a travel advisory for the greater Seattle area, warning reptilian metasapients that travel to the area is ill-advised at this time." />

		Title="Gardens Plagued by Surge in Local Wildlife"
		Date="11.28.2072"
		Content="Reports of a startling increase in local reptile populations have gotten the attention of the local Knight Errant forces, due in part to a dramatic increase in missing persons reports. Sources say the primary suspect is what K.E. forces are calling The BitterScales, a new gang composed of Naga and many paracritters in the area. Residents of the city of Seattle and surrounding areas are urged to report all suspicious activity to the authorities. " />

		Title="Hostilities Fly, Stocks Fall"
		Date="11.19.2072"
		Content="Stock prices have plummeted for Corps heavily invested in Energy Solutions, due to a new series of cyberattacks on power plants worldwide. Horizon is the most heavily affected, with a 12% drop in value overnight. As for the other Big Tens, Saeder-Krupp follows with a loss of nearly 6%, and Shiawase dropped almost 4% as well. The others fall in the 1-2% range, which is unlikely to bother them too badly. " />

		Title="Hot Pursuit In Cold Case"
		Date="11.12.2072"
		Content="In a follow-up investigation of the attack on a Horizon outpost early last month, Horizon representatives reported that they have identified aliases for two of the intruders. While much of the security footage was unuseable following severe damage to their security network, there was trace DNA evidence left behind that matches known shadowrunner aliases 'Simofin' and 'Lana'. By itself it's not enough to catch the perpetrators, but it will certainly help investigators find them in the future." />

		Title="Museum Loses Ancient Statue, Blames Supervising Agent"
		Date="11.10.2072"
		Content="The Seattle Museum of Magic and Technology was burgled last night when the nuclear attack protocols erroneously activated. Cyberlance Securities, the firm responsible for the museum's protection, have already issued a public statement admonishing the night staff for lack of diligence in their duties. They were especially critical of Chief Supervising Agent Marrik, who they say should have confirmed the nuclear attack prior to the lockdown procedure. Agent Marrik was unavailable for comment." />

		Title="Awakened Nope Ropes Roped Off"
		Date="10.30.2072"
		Content="A Shiawase mining facility fell into trouble yesterday when it unwittingly uncovered a nest of awakened proto-naga lifeforms. Reports indicate that most of the staff was killed in the ensuing conflict. Official word from Shiawase indicates the elevator malfunctioned, trapping the scientists and guards underground with the creatures. The two guards on the surface managed to mount a rescue saving the resident Astral expert, Hazel Williams. She was unavailable for comment." />

		Title="Local Corp Poised for Expansion"
		Date="10.25.2072"
		Content="Wraith Global Research, a company local to the greater Seattle area, has been bought out by Cerberus Logistics Net. Aztechnology had made their intent to buy Wrath Global clear, but due to a glitch in their systems it seems their bids had been blocked. Until a few months ago, nobody knew who CLN was, and they've been expanding rapidly following a series of very fortunate occurences for them. From the competition failing to collect relevant intel, to the mystifying attack on power plants across the globe earlier this month, CLN has taken advantage of these events to grow their budding empire. While they still only have an 'A' rating from the Court, their rapid growth has put them on all the Big Ten's radar. " />

		Title="Knights Errant Show Flawless Investigative Work"
		Date="â10.24.2072"
		Content="The KÃ¤hler Bank was robbed yesterday evening in a stunning display of cold, calculated efficiency. KE investigators found the branch manager and her husband in her home, both tied up and delirious after what appears to have been a rushed cybereye replacement surgury on her left eye. It's believed that her eye was used by the thieves in order to gain access to the vault, where they stole several dozen safety deposit boxes. Due to the private nature of the bank, no estimate for the value of those boxes is available at this time. An estimate of the damage to the building itself puts the costs of repair in the hundreds of thousands, a cost covered by the bank's comprehensive insurance policies. The bank manager and her husband are both being considered as possible suspects at this time." />

		Title="Yakuza Caught by Accident at Local Bank"
		Date="10.20.2072"
		Content="A local bank was terrorized earlier today, when a hail of gunfire was reported by clients in the building. When Knight Errant forces arrived, they found a dozen armed and confused individuals inside who have been found to all have ties to the local Yakuza cell. Nevertheless, no damage to the building was reported, no injuries were sustained, and no bullets appear to have been fired. Authorities are still trying to make sense of the eyewitness testimonies, but in the meantime the Yakuza are being held as suspects." />

		Title="Massive Cyberwar Rages in Shadows"
		Date="10.11.2072"
		Content="The investigation into the inexplicable hardware failures in numerous power stations several months ago has gotten a lucky break recently. In nearly every case, malicious code was discovered in the controlling mechanisms which caused unsafe operational parameters, leading to severe damage and ultimately failure. Such a systematic attack indicates an organized aggressor, rather than a sudden surge in negligence amongst power plant engineers. The evidence further suggests that the code entered all 1,417 locations simultaneously, and ran instantly rather than being injected and lying dormant waiting for a signal. This puzzling clue bodes ill for those targetted." />

		Title="Stolen Data on the Horizon"
		Date="10.03.2072"

		Title="Local Runners Caught Copsâ Bullets"
		Date="9.26.2072"
		Content="In a stunning display of militaristic police action, Knight Errant Armed Response teams located and surrounded the criminal group responsible for a number of devastating crimes including yesterday's tragic massacre at a personal storage facility. K.E. sources say the group refused to surrender, and the resulting firefight left all four of the gang dead amidst tens of thousands in damages to a local motel. As a testament to Knight Errant's abilities, no civilians were harmed in the raid." />

		Title="Reckless Crimes on the Rise in Downtown"
		Date="9.25.2072"
		Content="A brazen smash-and-grab heist was performed at ShadeStorage, a local company that specializes in personal storage solutions. While the company has yet to issue any statement regarding what was taken, their Knight Errant security insurance policy makes it clear that they are due a large sum to cover their losses. The perpetrators are believed to be the same group that has several other high profile cases attributed to them, but there is no news on whether K.E. has any substantial leads to their whereabouts at this time." />

		Title="Saeder-Krupp Launches into Aerospace Enthusiastically"
		Date="9.22.2072"
		Content="A satellite was launched earlier today by Wraith Global Research, a propulsions and communications company.  The satellite was created for Saeder-Krupp, who intend to use it for commucations with their most ambitious space station proposal to date.  The station has cost an estimated 20Â¥ billion to design and is expected to cost an additional 150Â¥ billion to launch in fourteen different parts over the next few months.  While SK is withholding information on the exact nature of the research planned on the station, an official spokesman for the Corp has stated that it will be placed in orbit around the sun.  With energy prices on the rise, many speculate that SK is looking to corner the solar energy market; a move that could put Horizon and possibly others among the megas out of trillions in revenue from energy sales.

		Title="World Power Shifts"
		Date="8.02.2072"
		Content="A series of sudden hardware failures have occured in dozens of low-level power plants across the world this week, putting many areas without reliable electricity.  The failures hit seemingly random power plants owned by dozens of different corporations, leaving investigators puzzling over possible causes.  The remaining stations will begin working at full capacity, only barely generating enough electricity for the general public.  Until further power stations can be built, the public is urged to conserve electricity by limiting high-consumption applications such as air conditioning and trideo gaming." />

		Date="7.18.2072"
		Content="Explosions rocked the western fringe of Seattle today, as a bridge along I-203 suddenly collapsed underneath a convoy heading to one of the many remote launch sites in the region. The rocket and its payload were destroyed when they landed in the canyon, several hundred feet below. While the Corp that owned the rocket wish to remain anonymous, they did release that the launch was scheduled for two weeks from today. Reports indicate the bridge's maintenance had been neglected for years, leading to a faulty support brace buckling under the pressure of so many heavily loaded vehicles." />
